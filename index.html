            <p>Welcome to my portfolio site! You can find my
              general resume,
              project portfolio,
              and some writing I've done.

              I'm Logan Forman, a game / systems programmer from New Mexico. I've been playing games as long as I can remember, and programming them since I was 11. I am currently finishing a B.S in Applied Mathematics at NM Tech University; I'll be done in Spring 2023 so I am looking for a job after that!
            </p>

            <p>
              I love observing the emergent consequences of complicated programs; Seeing how systems react when pushed on in unintended ways. These moments can reveal annoying problems or invaluable treasure. As I switched my university education from software development to applied math I found that my interests in math and programming aren't exactly seperate. I'm excited to explore the intersection of these passions for as long as I can.
