Welcome to my portfolio site! You can find my

I'm Logan Forman, a game and systems programmer from New Mexico. I've been playing games as long as I can remember and programming them since I was 11. I am currently finishing a B.S in Applied Mathematics at ?(New Mexico Tech, NMT) University; I'll be done in Spring 2023 so I am looking for a job after that!


I love observing the emergent consequences of complex programs; Seeing how systems react when pushed on in unintended ways. These moments can reveal annoying problems or invaluable treasure. As I switched my university education from software development to applied math I found that my interests in math and programming aren't exactly seperate. I'm excited to explore the intersection of these passions for as long as I can.
