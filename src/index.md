## Brief

I'm Logan Forman, a programmer and mathematician from New Mexico. I've been playing games as long as I can remember and programming them since I was 11. 
Later on I broadened my horizons and picked up more general programming and math skills. Since graduating from NMT I've been working in New Mexico's Aerospace Industry. 

I love observing the emergent consequences of complex programs; Seeing how systems react when pushed on in unintended ways. 
These moments can reveal annoying problems or invaluable treasure. 
As I switched my university education from software development to applied math I found that my interests in math and programming aren't separate. 
I'm excited to explore the intersection of these passions for as long as I can!
