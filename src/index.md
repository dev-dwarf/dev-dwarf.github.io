## Brief
I'm Logan Forman, a game and systems programmer from New Mexico. I've been playing games as long as I can remember and programming them since I was 11. 


I love observing the emergent consequences of complex programs; Seeing how systems react when pushed on in unintended ways. These moments can reveal annoying problems or invaluable treasure. As I switched my university education from software development to applied math I found that my interests in math and programming aren't seperate. I'm excited to explore the intersection of these passions for as long as I can!
