## Custom Game Engine (very WIP)
Custom game engine codebase built in C++ with minimal libraries.


Not much to say about this yet except that I have been deep-diving into Platform APIs for Windowing, Input, Rendering, Sound, and seemingly endless other topics. Once I duct-tape some games together with this I'll have more to say!

## Static Site Generator (WIP)
A Static Site Generator used to make this website, made in (C-like) C++. 
Features:
* Compile a Markdown-like language to html.
* Add html boilerplate for each page automatically.
* Easily customizeable, Small Codebase (<1000 LOC).
Source on @(https://github.com/dev-dwarf/dev-dwarf.github.io Github).
Read my posts about making this @(/writing.html#making-a-ssg.html here).

## LCF (WIP)
My personal @(http://nothings.org/stb.h stb.h) style standard libary for my C/C++ projects. Features:
* Shorter type names and macros for commonly used functionality.
* Arena-oriented memory management library.
* Length-based string library (composes with Arena library).
Source is not available yet because I update this very frequently and don't want others to use it yet. It may seem unnecessary to do this to some but I've found that making my own standard library has given me deeper insight into how the available primitives in a language affect my programming style, as well as greatly increasing my comfort level in my C/C++ codebases (Feels worth it just for string handling alone!)
